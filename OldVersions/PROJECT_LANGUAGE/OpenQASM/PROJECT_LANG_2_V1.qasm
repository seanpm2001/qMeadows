OPENQASM 2.0
// Start of script

// Project language file 2
// For: Meadows/qMeadows
// About:
// I chose OpenQASM as the second project language file for this project (Meadows/qMeadows) as I feel that OpenQASM is the appropriate assembly language to use for this project. It may be supplemented or replaced with another language in the future. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
